The data being using is from the U.S. Small Business Administration 
<br>
<br>
<br>

 It provides historical data from 1987 until 2014 
<br>
<br>
<br>

There are 27 variables and 899,164 observations each representing a loan
</div>
</body>

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

loan01 = read.csv("https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/SBAloan/w06-SBAnational01.csv", header = TRUE)[, -1]

#  <h2 align="center">Remove missing values</h2>
<br>
<br>


- We begin by removing any loans that are missing an MIS Status
<br>
<br>

- Removing the missing MIS status values allows for the data to be equal for each of the samples
<br>
<br>

- We find there are 155 MIS values missing

```{r Remove Missing Values, echo=FALSE}

###1 Remove missing MIS_Status values 
sum2 <- sum(is.na(loan$MIS_Status))
nloan <- na.omit(loan)

```

# <h2 align="center">Map of Regions</h2>

<div align="center">
<img src="img/map.png" width ="55%">
</div>

---

#  <h2 align="center">Stratifing the Population</h2>
<br>

We stratify the population based on the region the loan is in 
<br>

By stratifying the data into regions we have created 9 sub populations
<br>

This will allow us to see a more accurate result due to there being smaller sample sizes

- New England 
- Mid-Atlantic
- South
- Great Lakes
- Midwest
- Pacific Coast
- Non Continental
- Rocky Mountain 
- Southwest

# Cluster by Zip Code
<br>
<br>
- We cluster by zip code using the entire study population. We will create clusters and select 9 of them to be used as the final study population.
<br>
<br>
<br>

- When clustering by zip code it is important for the researchers to know we have a chance of getting no data from smaller areas as they may be picked less often.
```{r echo=FALSE}
nloan <- nloan[!is.na(nloan$Zip), ]

num_clusters <- 9

kmeans_result <- kmeans(nloan$Zip, centers = num_clusters)

cluster_centers <- kmeans_result$centers

nloan$Cluster <- kmeans_result$cluster

```

# Simple Random Sampling 
<br>
<br>

- A simple random sample allows for each observation to have an equal chance of being chosen
<br>
<br>
<br>

- A sample size of 100 


```{r echo=FALSE}

set.seed(123)  
random_sample <- sample_n(nloan, size = 100)  

```

---

# Systematic Sample
<br>
<br>

- A systematic sample uses a random sample from the population at a fixed interval of 50
<br>
<br>
<br>

- By using the systematic sample there will be no influence over which loans are chosen allowing for the study to be unbiased.
```{r echo=FALSE}

systematic_sample <- nloan[seq(1, nrow(nloan), by = 50), ]
```

---

# Stratified Sample
<br>
<br>

- A stratified sample will be done using the 9 regions we created earlier in the study.
<br>
<br>
<br>

- A sample proportional to 10% of the total number loans in each region is taken per region. This keeps the proportion of observations from each region equal to that of the total population.

<h2 align="center">Best Sampling method</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>

- Found Stratified yields best results
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Guarantee all regions are weighted equally


---

<h2 align="center">Conclusion</h2>
<br>
<br>

- Throughout the study we have looked at the data provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration 
<br>
<br>


- Used 4 different sampling methods to analysis loans
<br>
<br>

- We compared the true default with defalut rate using stratified sampling 
<br>
<br>
